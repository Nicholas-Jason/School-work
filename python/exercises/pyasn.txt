1. There is no equivalent for use strict in python and has an automatic warning system therefore there is no need to call it. The source of this information is stackoverflow.

4. The functional programming paradigm is when functions serve as the building blocks of a program. In this paradigm, computations are considered
the evaluation of matematic functions as expressions.This means that they declare a relationship between two or more entities. The focus of functional
programming is abstraction and reducing complexity making the program easier to understand.An example of functional programming in python is the existence
of the iterator object.The iterator contains a stream of data and returns it one element at a time.It also has built-in function called next() that references
the element of the data that succeeds the current element.This is an example of functional programming because it declares a relationship between two or more entitiesSources: Python Software Foundation and c2.com.
